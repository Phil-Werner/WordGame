The Word Game, AKA Worderefic, is a fun iPhone App I'm working on.  It's similar to boggle, but it's a one player game where the player tries to create
as many words as possible by dragging their finger along the letters on the letter board.  The longer the word the more points you get!  You can also
get bonus stars by accomplishing one (or more) of the three goals given at the beginning of the game.  Bonus stars are worth a lot of points 
but can also be used to buy vowels which might allow you to create long words.  I hope to have it up on the App store soon!
